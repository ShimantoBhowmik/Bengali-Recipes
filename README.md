# **Project : Bengali-Recipes**
 A website with 12 of the most famous Bengali dishes with Recipe links to those dishes.

## Technologies Used
 This frontend application was built using React. The concepts I had to learn to build this application included react scripts, Hooks, Class components,
 States, mapping arrays, Lifecycle methods as well as understand the Renders and Re-Renders. Also learnt to use React Devtools in order to debug and apply
 styling to my components for this application.
